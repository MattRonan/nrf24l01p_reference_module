The nrf24l01+ is cheap, well documented, and easy to use, but is way less available than it was a few years ago. I made this based on Nordic's reference module so that  
I wouldnt have to rely on amazon or ali baba suppliers in the future.  The Nordic PDF has extra info about component selection and related things, and is on their website at https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF24-series

The pdf that this board is based off of is under nRF24Files/nRF24L01P-EK/Documentation/nRF24L01pluss_REFERENCE_MODULES

There are improvements that can be made, most of all shrinking the antenna size down to match typical nrf modules but this is a good starting point
