The nrf24l01+ is cheap, well documented, and easy to use, but is way less available than it was a few years ago. I made this based on Nordic's reference module so that  
I wouldnt have to rely on amazon or ali baba suppliers in the future.  I would link the Nordic PDF since it has more info about component selection and stuff but I don't know if that's allowed.  So hopefully it will remain available on their website at https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF24-series
The pdf that this board is based off of is under nRF24Files/nRF24L01P-EK/Documentation/nRF24L01pluss_REFERENCE_MODULES
